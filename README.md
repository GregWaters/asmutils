# Linux utilities in x86 Assembly

Small, fast executables for daily command-line tasks.

# Build all binaries

All you need to build the project is run `make` in the project directory. From there, all object files will reside in `obj/`, and all executables will reside in `bin/`

# Build individual binary

To build an individual binary, simply run `make` with the name of the command to build. Ex: `make clear`, `make true`, etc.
